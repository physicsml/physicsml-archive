        <p>When I first encountered a Boltzmann Machine, I did not immediately see its appeal to a quantum many-body physicist.<br>
A Boltzmann Machine is a stochastic neural network used to (approximately) learn probability distributions, 
and to generate samples from the learned distribution.  It is a common tool in feature extraction, 
classification, and other tasks in the modern machine learning community.</p>
<p>But why would we physicists need a learning tool to approximate distributions when, presumably, in order to 
obtain data to train the machine, we must already <code>know'' the distribution (or, at least, the Hamiltonian)?  
As a Monte Carlo practitioner, I am in the business of sampling from perfect 
distributions---a practice fraught with many difficulties as it is.  Why add further systematic 
error (on top of our statistical error) by sampling from an imperfect distribution, which presumably takes 
considerable computational effort to learn? The application of such a machine in the technology industry is 
more obvious.  There, we are trying to train a machine on (say) a finite-size number of cat pictures, 
with the goal of teaching the machine to generate, or</code>dream'', a picture of a cat no one has seen before.<br>
For me, each picture of a cat is instead (say) a spin configuration, each pixel an up or down spin 
state, sampled e.g. from the Boltzmann distribution at finite temperature.  This sampling is done with 
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo  procedure, an efficient algorithm honed by scientists since the end of 
World War II.  It seems we already have the distribution and know how to sample it very efficiently. 
Why use our samples to train an imperfect machine, the sampling of which may be less efficient than 
our existing algorithms, honed by scientists for the past 65 years?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm now a convert to the myriad possibilities that Boltzmann Machines present to the physicist.<br>
Over the last year, I've been watching the field develop with excitement.  One variant, the `Restricted' 
Boltzmann Machine (RBM), seems to hold particular promise as a tool for representing and sampling classical and 
quantum states (wavefunctions).  Below, I've outlined some of the promise inherent in RBMs for the field of 
condensed matter and quantum many-body physics.</p>
