develop methods to aid in the accurate preparation of quantum states for a
variety of materials, matter, and devices. Computational techniques can be used
to reconstruct a state from data, however the growing number of qubits demands
ongoing algorithmic advances in order to keep pace with experiments. In this
paper, we present an open-source software package called QuCumber that uses
machine learning to reconstruct a quantum state consistent with a set of
projective measurements. QuCumber uses a restricted Boltzmann machine to
efficiently represent the quantum wavefunction for a large number of qubits.
New measurements can be generated from the machine to obtain physical
observables not easily accessible from the original data.">"QuCumber: wavefunction reconstruction with neural networks"</a>,

solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining neural networks
with the Theory of Connections (ToC). ToC is used to transform PDEs with
boundary conditions into unconstrained optimization problems by embedding the
boundary conditions into a &quot;constrained expression&quot; that contains a neural
network. The loss function for the unconstrained optimization problem is taken
to be the square of the residual of the PDE. Then, the neural network is
trained in an unsupervised manner to solve the unconstrained optimization
problem. This methodology has two major advantages over other popular methods
used to estimate the solutions of PDEs. First, this methodology does not need
to discretize the domain into a grid, which becomes prohibitive as the
dimensionality of the PDE increases. Instead, this methodology randomly samples
points from the domain during the training phase. Second, after training, this
methodology represents a closed form, analytical, differentiable approximation
of the solution throughout the entire training domain. In contrast, other
popular methods require interpolation if the estimated solution is desired at
points that do not lie on the discretized grid. The deep ToC method for
estimating the solution of PDEs is demonstrated on four problems with a variety
of boundary conditions.">"Deep ToC: A New Method for Estimating the Solutions of PDEs"</a>,

quantum computation. However, determining the most suited encoding for unknown
error channels or specific laboratory setups is highly challenging. Here, we
present a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing and fault-tolerantly
adapting quantum error correction codes. We consider a reinforcement learning
agent tasked with modifying a quantum memory until a desired logical error rate
is reached. Using efficient simulations of a surface code quantum memory with
about 70 physical qubits, we demonstrate that such a reinforcement learning
agent can determine near-optimal solutions, in terms of the number of physical
qubits, for various error models of interest. Moreover, we show that agents
trained on one task are able to transfer their experience to similar tasks.
This ability for transfer learning showcases the inherent strengths of
reinforcement learning and the applicability of our approach for optimization
both in off-line simulations and on-line under laboratory conditions.">"Optimizing Quantum Error Correction Codes with Reinforcement Learning"</a>,

optimization - the choice of intensities and probabilities of sending them - is
a crucial step to gain optimal performance. Traditionally, such an optimization
relies on brute-force search, or local search algorithm such as Coordinate
Descent. Here we present a new method of using a neural network to learn to
predict the optimal point for the convex optimization of parameters for QKD
with any given set of experiment devices and quantum channel conditions.
Selecting one protocol (symmetric 4-intensity measurement-device-independent
QKD) as an example, we show that with neural-network-predicted parameters we
can achieve over 99.99% of the optimal key rate. Harnessing the parallel
processing power of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the neural network
allows us to efficiently pre-generate on a desktop PC a large &quot;look-up table&quot;
of optimal parameters for all possible experimental parameter and channel
conditions, up to a finite resolution, and deploy this table to low-power
devices. This eliminates the need for any on-device computation, and allows us
to deploy finite-size QKD with optimal parameter setting to low-power mobile
QKD devices that have limited computing power, short communication time, and
quickly changing channel losses and experimental parameters (e.g. misalignment
and background noise), such as in satellite, drone, or handheld QKD systems. We
show that, on a Raspberry Pi 3 single-board computer, using look-up table is up
to 15-25 times faster than local search. In addition to the look-up table
method, we also point out the potential to directly deploy neural networks to
an increasing number of mobile devices equipped with neural processing units

the temperature can be reformulated as a classification problem in Machine
Learning. Taking as a prototype the Ising model and using the Support Vector
Machine as a tool to classify Monte Carlo generated configurations, we show
that the critical region of the system can be clearly identified and the
symmetry that drives the transition can be reconstructed from the performance
of the learning process. The role of the discrete symmetry of the system in
obtaining this result is discussed. A finite size analysis of the learned
Support Vector Machine decision function allows us to determine the critical
temperature and critical exponents with a precision that is comparable to that
of the most efficient numerical approaches relying on a known Hamiltonian
description of the system. For the determination of the critical temperature
and of the critical exponent connected with the divergence of the correlation
length, other than the availability of a range of temperatures having
information on both phases, the method we propose does not rest on any physical
input on the system, and in particular is agnostic to its Hamiltonian, its
symmetry properties and its order parameter. Hence, our investigation provides
a first significant step in the direction of devising robust tools for

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06693v1" title="Quantum State Tomography is the task of determining an unknown quantum state
by making measurements on identical copies of the state. Current algorithms are
costly both on the experimental front -- requiring vast numbers of measurements
-- as well as in terms of the computational time to analyze those measurements.
In this paper, we address the problem of analysis speed and flexibility,
introducing \textit{Neural Adaptive Quantum State Tomography} (NA-QST), a
machine learning based algorithm for quantum state tomography that adapts
measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster processing while retaining
state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. Our algorithm is inspired by particle
swarm optimization and Bayesian particle-filter based adaptive methods, which
we extend and enhance using neural networks. The resampling step, in which a
bank of candidate solutions -- particles -- is refined, is in our case learned
directly from data, removing the computational bottleneck of standard methods.
We successfully replace the Bayesian calculation that requires computational
time of \(O(\mathrm{poly}(n))\) with a learned heuristic whose time complexity
empirically scales as \(O(\log(n))\) with the number of copies measured \(n\),
while retaining the same reconstruction accuracy. This corresponds to a factor
of a million speedup for \(10^7\) copies measured. We demonstrate that our
algorithm learns to work with basis, symmetric informationally complete (SIC),
as well as other types of POVMs. We discuss the value of measurement adaptivity
for each POVM type, demonstrating that its effect is significant only for basis
POVMs. Our algorithm can be retrained within hours on a single laptop for a
two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended to
larger systems. It can also adapt to a subset of possible states, a choice of
the type of measurement, and other experimental details.">"Adaptive Quantum State Tomography with Neural Networks"</a>,

of a classical system by slowly decreasing the hopping rates of a quantum
random walk in the configuration space of the problem, where the on-site
energies are provided by the classical energy function. In a quantum
reinforcement algorithm, the annealing works instead by increasing gradually
the strength of the on-site energies according to the probability of finding
the walker on each site of the configuration space. Here, by using the
path-integral Monte Carlo simulations of the quantum algorithms, we show that
annealing via reinforcement can significantly enhance the success probability
of the quantum walker. More precisely, we implement a local version of the
quantum reinforcement algorithm, where the system wave function is replaced by
an approximate wave function using the local expectation values of the system.
We use this algorithm to find solutions to a prototypical constraint
satisfaction problem (XORSAT) close to the satisfiability to unsatisfiability
phase transition. The study is limited to small problem sizes (a few hundreds
of variables), nevertheless, the numerical results suggest that quantum
reinforcement may provide a useful strategy to deal with other computationally
hard problems and larger problem sizes even as a classical optimization
algorithm.">"Enhancing the efficiency of quantum annealing via reinforcement: A

interacting with the world. Endowing an autonomous agent with an understanding
of physical laws through experience and observation is seldom practical: we
should seek alternatives. Fortunately, many of the laws of behaviour of the
physical world can be derived from prior knowledge of dynamical systems,
expressed through the use of partial differential equations. In this work, we
suggest a neural network capable of understanding a specific physical
phenomenon: wave propagation in a two-dimensional medium. We define
`understanding' in this context as the ability to predict the future evolution
of the spatial patterns of rendered wave amplitude from a relatively small set
of initial observations. The inherent complexity of the wave equations --
together with the existence of reflections and interference -- makes the
prediction problem non-trivial. A network capable of making approximate
predictions also unlocks the opportunity to speed-up numerical simulations for
wave propagation. To this aim, we created a novel dataset of simulated wave
motion and built a predictive deep neural network comprising of three main
blocks: an encoder, a propagator made by 3 LSTMs, and a decoder. Results show
reasonable predictions for as long as 80 time steps into the future on a
dataset not seen during training. Furthermore, the network is able to
generalize to an initial condition that is qualitatively different from those
seen during training.">"Approximating the solution to wave propagation using deep neural

for a range of applications. Here we focus on quantum metrology. First, we
consider the noise-free case, and use the algorithm to find quantum states with
a large quantum Fisher information (QFI). We find methods, which only involve
experimental elements that are available with current technology, for
engineering quantum states with up to a 100-fold improvement over the best
classical state, and a 20-fold improvement over the optimal Gaussian state.
Such states are a superposition of the vacuum with a large number of photons
(around 80), and can hence be seen as Schr\&quot;odinger-cat-like states. We then
apply the two most dominant noise sources in our setting -- photon loss and
imperfect heralding -- and use the algorithm to find quantum states that still
improve over the optimal Gaussian state with realistic levels of noise. This
will open up experimental and technological work in using exotic non-Gaussian
states for quantum-enhanced phase measurements. Finally, we use the Bayesian
mean square error to look beyond the regime of validity of the QFI, finding
quantum states with precision enhancements over the alternatives even when the

wave-function is an important approach to the quantum many-body problem. In
this approach, the main challenges include the design of a suitable variational
ansatz and optimization of its parameters. In this work, we address both of
these challenges. First, we define the variational class of Computational Graph

variational ansatz. Secondly, we develop a novel optimization scheme,
supervised wave-function optimization (SWO), which systematically improves the
optimized wave-function by drawing on ideas from supervised learning. While SWO
can be used independently of CGS, utilizing them together provides a flexible
framework for the rapid design, prototyping and optimization of variational
wave-functions. We demonstrate CGS and SWO by optimizing for the ground state
wave-function of 1D and 2D Heisenberg models on nine different variational
architectures including architectures not previously used to represent quantum

approaches. One interesting application of this architectural exploration is

phase transitions in many-body systems. However, most studies are tied to
situations involving only one phase transition and one order parameter. Systems
that accommodate multiple phases of coexisting and competing orders, which are
common in condensed matter physics, remain largely unexplored from a machine
learning perspective. In this paper, we investigate multiclassification of
phases using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and apply a recently introduced
kernel method for detecting hidden spin and orbital orders to learn multiple
phases and their analytical order parameters. Our focus is on multipolar orders
and their tensorial order parameters whose identification is difficult with
traditional methods. The importance of interpretability is emphasized for
physical applications of multiclassification. Furthermore, we discuss an
intrinsic parameter of SVM, the bias, which allows for a special interpretation
in the classification of phases, and its utility in diagnosing the existence of
phase transitions. We show that it can be exploited as an efficient way to
explore the topology of unknown phase diagrams where the supervision is
entirely delegated to the machine.">"Learning multiple order parameters with interpretable machines"</a>,

condensates (BEC) faster than the adiabatic timescale (without excitation or
loss) have been well developed theoretically, experimental implementations of
these protocols have yet to reach speeds faster than the adiabatic timescale.
In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative approach based on a

algorithm is given control of the coupled decompression and transport of a
metastable helium condensate, with its performance determined after each
experimental iteration by measuring the excitations of the resultant BEC. After
each iteration the algorithm adjusts its internal model of the system to create
an improved control output for the next iteration. Given sufficient control
over the decompression, the algorithm converges to a novel solution that sets

networks. While generic deep ANNs are hard to contract, meaning that the
corresponding state amplitude can not be exactly evaluated, the GTMS network is
shown to be analytically contractible using transfer matrix methods. With
numerical simulations, we demonstrate how the GTMS network learns random matrix
product states in a supervised learning scheme, and how augmenting the network

the phase boundaries of the Active Ising Model (AIM) starting from an ensemble
of configurations of the system. We illustrate that unsupervised learning
techniques are powerful at identifying the phase boundaries in the phase space
of control variables, even in situations of coexistent phases. It is
demonstrated that supervised learning with neural networks is capable of
learning the characteristics about the phase diagram, such that the obtained
knowledge at a specific set of control variables can be used to trace the phase
boundaries across the phase diagram. In this way we demonstrate that properly
designed supervised learning provides predictive power to regions in the phase

described by a final state that is approximately classical. Using an effective
Hamiltonian, we first show why the transition amplitudes that increase
occupation numbers are exponentially suppressed and how a very special family
of classicalizing theories compensates this suppression. This is thanks to a
large micro-state entropy generated by the emergent gapless modes around the
final classical state. The dressing of the process by the super-soft quanta of
these modes compensates the exponential suppression of the transition
probability. Hence, an unsuppressed classicalization takes place exclusively
into the states of exponentially enhanced memory storage capacity. Next, we
describe this phenomenon in the language of a quantum neural network, in which
the neurons are represented as interconnected quantum modes with gravity-like
negative-energy synaptic connections. We show that upon an injection of energy
in form of a hard quantum stimulus, the network reaches the classicalized state
of exponentially enhanced memory capacity with order one probability. We
construct a simple model in which the transition results into classical states
that carry an area-law micro-state entropy. In this language, a non-Wilsonian
UV-completion of the Standard Model via classicalization implies that above

often characterized by a vast number of input parameters. Performing
uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost
always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even
millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics.
One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace
the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters,
one has to deal with the curse of dimensionality - the exponential increase in
the volume of the input space, as the number of parameters increases linearly.
In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct
surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the
DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a
low dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized
nonlinear function of the low dimensional projections of the input. We think of
this low dimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of
the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty
propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with
uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of
the SPDE problem by not imposing a specific covariance structure on the random

probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from
each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML,
investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve
the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both
directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital
application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our &quot;big data&quot; world.
Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become
instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in
data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments,
quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning,
highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works
exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for
performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first
successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also
broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts.
This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a
world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the
main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research

volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the

from classification to AI. Learning corresponds to fitting training data, which
is implemented by descending a very high-dimensional loss function.
Understanding under which conditions neural networks do not get stuck in poor
minima of the loss, and how the landscape of that loss evolves as depth is
increased remains a challenge. Here we predict, and test empirically, an
analogy between this landscape and the energy landscape of repulsive ellipses.
We argue that in FC networks a phase transition delimits the over- and
under-parametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. In the
vicinity of this transition, properties of the curvature of the minima of the
loss are critical. This transition shares direct similarities with the jamming
transition by which particles form a disordered solid as the density is
increased, which also occurs in certain classes of computational optimization
and learning problems such as the perceptron. Our analysis gives a simple
explanation as to why poor minima of the loss cannot be encountered in the
overparametrized regime, and puts forward the surprising result that the
ability of fully connected networks to fit random data is independent of their
depth. Our observations suggests that this independence also holds for real
data. We also study a quantity \(\Delta\) which characterizes how well
(\(\Delta&lt;0\)) or badly (\(\Delta&gt;0\)) a datum is learned. At the critical point it
is power-law distributed, \(P_+(\Delta)\sim\Delta^\theta\) for \(\Delta&gt;0\) and
\(P_-(\Delta)\sim(-\Delta)^{-\gamma}\) for \(\Delta&lt;0\), with \(\theta\approx0.3\)
and \(\gamma\approx0.2\). This observation suggests that near the transition the
loss landscape has a hierarchical structure and that the learning dynamics is
prone to avalanche-like dynamics, with abrupt changes in the set of patterns
that are learned.">"The jamming transition as a paradigm to understand the loss landscape of

display the same (random) Gibbs measure of bi-partite spin-glasses, whose
rigorous treatment is notoriously difficult. In this work, beyond providing a
brief review on RBMs, we aim to contribute to their analytical investigation,
by considering two distinct realizations of their weights (i.e., Boolean and
Gaussian) and studying the properties of their related free energies. More
precisely, focusing on a RBM characterized by digital couplings, we first
extend the Pastur-Shcherbina-Tirozzi method (originally developed for the
Hopfield model) to prove the self-averaging property for the free energy, over
its quenched expectation, in the infinite volume limit, then we explicitly
calculate its simplest approximation, namely its annealed bound. Next, focusing

replica symmetry: we get self-consistencies for the order parameters (in full
agreement with the existing Literature) as well as the critical line for
ergodicity breaking that turns out to be the same obtained in AGS theory. As we

complex, natural systems like cells and brains. In machine learning, the
predictive power or generalizability of a model is determined by the statistics

Thermal noise drives a system to explore a range of configurations providing

Conversely, thermal energy degrades information by blurring energetic
differences between network states. In general, spin networks have an intrinsic
optimal temperature at which inference becomes maximally efficient. Simple

many-particle systems are of interest. In the seemingly unrelated field of
machine learning, deep network architectures have exhibited an unprecedented
ability to tractably encompass the dependencies characterizing hard learning
tasks such as image classification. However, key questions regarding deep
learning architecture design still have no adequate theoretical answers. In
this paper, we establish a Tensor Network (TN) based common language between
the two disciplines, which allows us to offer bidirectional contributions. By
showing that many-body wave-functions are structurally equivalent to mappings
of ConvACs and RACs, we construct their TN equivalents, and suggest quantum

Accordingly, we propose a novel entanglement based deep learning design scheme.
In the other direction, we identify that an inherent re-use of information in
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures is a key trait that distinguishes
them from TNs. We suggest a new TN manifestation of information re-use, which
enables TN constructs of powerful architectures such as deep recurrent networks
and overlapping convolutional networks. This allows us to theoretically
demonstrate that the entanglement scaling supported by these architectures can
surpass that of commonly used TNs in 1D, and can support volume law

RBM to be mainly reflected by spectral properties of its weight matrix W. A
phase diagram is obtained which seems at first sight similar to the one of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with ferromagnetic couplings. The main
difference resides in the structure of the ferromagnetic phase which may or may
not be of compositional type, depending mainly on the distribution's kurtosis

the aforementioned ensemble average and involving explicitly order parameters
obtained from the thermodynamic analysis. This accounts in particular for the
dominant singular values evolution and how this is driven by the input data: in
the linear regime at the beginning of the learning, they correspond to unstable
deformation modes of W reflecting dominant covariance modes of the data. In the
non-linear regime it is seen how the selected modes interact in later stages of
the learning procedure, by eventually imposing a matching between order

graph structured input data and ii) a better understanding and analysis of deep
networks and related learning algorithms. With this in mind we focus on the
topological classification of reachability in a particular subset of planar
graphs (Mazes). Doing so, we are able to model the topology of data while
staying in Euclidean space, thus allowing its processing with standard CNN
architectures. We suggest a suitable architecture for this problem and show
that it can express a perfect solution to the classification task. The shape of
the cost function around this solution is also derived and, remarkably, does
not depend on the size of the maze in the large maze limit. Responsible for
this behavior are rare events in the dataset which strongly regulate the shape
of the cost function near this global minimum. We further identify an obstacle
to learning in the form of poorly performing local minima in which the network
chooses to ignore some of the inputs. We further support our claims with
training experiments and numerical analysis of the cost function on networks
with up to \(128\) layers.">"Critical Percolation as a Framework to Analyze the Training of Deep

machine learning applications. Formal understanding on what makes these
networks so successful is gradually unfolding, but for the most part there are
still significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects
prior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this
work, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum
physics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel
theoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each
layer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias.
Specifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep
convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave
function, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This
facilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined
quantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate
correlation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a
deep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available. This description
enables us to carry a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, with
which we demonstrate a direct control over the inductive bias of the deep
network via its channel numbers, that are related to the min-cut in the
underlying graph. This result is relevant to any practitioner designing a
network for a specific task. We theoretically analyze ConvACs, and empirically

Plane}; i.e., the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer
preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of
the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between
compression and prediction, successively, for each layer.
  In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of
the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\emph compression} of the
input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii)
The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes
small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift
to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion,
constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or
very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps
from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output
satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise
mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks.
(iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers.
Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be
explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly
(exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the
previous layer.">"Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks via Information"</a>,

introduce q-means, a new quantum algorithm for clustering which is a canonical
problem in unsupervised machine learning. The \(q\)-means algorithm has
convergence and precision guarantees similar to \(k\)-means, and it outputs with
high probability a good approximation of the \(k\) cluster centroids like the
classical algorithm. Given a dataset of \(N\) \(d\)-dimensional vectors \(v_i\) (seen
as a matrix \(V \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d})\) stored in QRAM, the running time
of q-means is \(\widetilde{O}\left( k d \frac{\eta}{\delta^2}\kappa(V)(\mu(V) +
k \frac{\eta}{\delta}) + k^2 \frac{\eta^{1.5}}{\delta^2} \kappa(V)\mu(V)

polylogarithmic in the number of datapoints \(N\). Our algorithm provides
substantial savings compared to the classical \(k\)-means algorithm that runs in

are variational quantum perceptron (VQP) and a quantum generalization of
classical ensemble learning. Our VQP employs parameterized quantum circuits to
learn a Grover search (or amplitude amplification) operation with classical
optimization, and can achieve quadratic speedup in query complexity compared to
its classical counterparts. We show how the trained VQP can be used to predict
future data with \(O(1)\) {query} complexity. Ultimately, a stronger nonlinear
classifier can be established, the so-called quantum ensemble learning (QEL),
by combining a set of weak VQPs produced using a subsampling method. The
subsampling method has two significant advantages. First, all \(T\) weak VQPs
employed in QEL can be trained in parallel, therefore, the query complexity of
QEL is equal to that of each weak VQP multiplied by \(T\). Second, it
dramatically reduce the {runtime} complexity of encoding circuits that map
classical data to a quantum state because this dataset can be significantly
smaller than the original dataset given to QEL. This arguably provides a most
satisfactory solution to one of the most criticized issues in quantum machine
learning proposals. To conclude, we perform two numerical experiments for our

and identify errors that affect encoded quantum information. At this interface
of classical and quantum computing the technique of machine learning has
appeared as a way to tailor such an algorithm to the specific error processes
of an experiment --- without the need for a priori knowledge of the error
model. Here, we apply this technique to topological color codes. We demonstrate
that a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory cells can be
trained to reduce the error rate \(\epsilon_{\rm L}\) of the encoded logical
qubit to values much below the error rate \(\epsilon_{\rm phys}\) of the physical
qubits --- fitting the expected power law scaling \(\epsilon_{\rm L} \propto
\epsilon_{\rm phys}^{(d+1)/2}\), with \(d\) the code distance. The neural network
incorporates the information from &quot;flag qubits&quot; to avoid reduction in the
effective code distance caused by the circuit. As a test, we apply the neural
network decoder to a density-matrix based simulation of a superconducting
quantum computer, demonstrating that the logical qubit has a longer life-time
than the constituting physical qubits with near-term experimental parameters.">"Neural network decoder for topological color codes with circuit level

quantum computing gates. On the other hand, quantum mechanics offers
tantalizing prospects to enhance machine learning, ranging from reduced
computational complexity to improved generalization performance. The most
notable examples include quantum enhanced algorithms for principal component
analysis, quantum support vector machines, and quantum Boltzmann machines.
Progress has been rapid, fostered by demonstrations of midsized quantum
optimizers which are predicted to soon outperform their classical counterparts.
Further, we are witnessing the emergence of a physical theory pinpointing the
fundamental and natural limitations of learning. Here we survey the cutting
edge of this merger and list several open problems.">"Quantum Machine Learning"</a>,

classifying large numbers of vectors in high-dimensional spaces. Classical
algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the
number of vectors and the dimension of the space. Quantum computers are good at
manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. This
paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms
for cluster assignment and cluster finding. Quantum machine learning can take
time logarithmic in both the number of vectors and their dimension, an
exponential speed-up over classical algorithms.">"Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning"</a>,

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411140v2" title="In this article we give several new results on the complexity of algorithms
that learn Boolean functions from quantum queries and quantum examples.
  Hunziker et al. conjectured that for any class C of Boolean functions, the
number of quantum black-box queries which are required to exactly identify an
unknown function from C is \(O(\frac{\log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})\),
where \(\hat{\gamma}^{C}\) is a combinatorial parameter of the class C. We
essentially resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by giving a quantum
algorithm that, for any class C, identifies any unknown function from C using
\(O(\frac{\log |C| \log \log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})\) quantum black-box
queries.
  We consider a range of natural problems intermediate between the exact
learning problem (in which the learner must obtain all bits of information
about the black-box function) and the usual problem of computing a predicate
(in which the learner must obtain only one bit of information about the
black-box function). We give positive and negative results on when the quantum
and classical query complexities of these intermediate problems are
polynomially related to each other.
  Finally, we improve the known lower bounds on the number of quantum examples
(as opposed to quantum black-box queries) required for \((\epsilon,\delta)\)-PAC
learning any concept class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension d over the domain
\(\{0,1\}^n\) from \(\Omega(\frac{d}{n})\) to \(\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log
\frac{1}{\delta}+d+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon})\). This new lower bound comes
closer to matching known upper bounds for classical PAC learning.">"Improved Bounds on Quantum Learning Algorithms"</a>,
