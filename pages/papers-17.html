Samplers, poses a major challenge for any research program that aims to show
quantum advantages over classical hardware. To address this problem, we propose
a novel data-driven approach wherein models are trained to identify common
pathologies using unsupervised machine learning methods. We illustrate this
idea by training a classifier that exploits K-means clustering to distinguish
between Boson Samplers that use indistinguishable photons from those that do
not. We train the model on numerical simulations of small-scale Boson Samplers
and then validate the pattern recognition technique on larger numerical
simulations as well as on photonic chips in both traditional Boson Sampling and
scattershot experiments. The effectiveness of such method relies on
particle-type-dependent internal correlations present in the output
distributions. This approach performs substantially better on the test data
than previous methods and underscores the ability to further generalize its
operation beyond the scope of the examples that it was trained on.">"Pattern recognition techniques for Boson Sampling validation"</a>,

chain Monte-Carlo algorithms for euclidean field theories on the lattice. Our
proposing algorithm is the Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm (HMC) with restricted
Boltzmann machine. We examine the validity of the algorithm by employing the
phi-fourth theory in three dimension. We observe reduction of the
autocorrelation both in symmetric and broken phase as well. Our proposing
algorithm provides consistent central values of expectation values of the
action density and one-point Green's function with ones from the original HMC
in both the symmetric phase and broken phase within the statistical error. On
the other hand, two-point Green's functions have slight difference between one
calculated by the HMC and one by our proposing algorithm in the symmetric
phase. Furthermore, near the criticality, the distribution of the one-point
Green's function differs from the one from HMC. We discuss the origin of
discrepancies and its improvement.">"Towards reduction of autocorrelation in HMC by machine learning"</a>,

mapping the observed results of the quantum state onto a neural network. In the
present study, we utilized the simplest case of a quantum many-body system,
namely a one-dimensional chain of Ising spins with the transverse Ising model.
We prepared several spin configurations, which were obtained using repeated
observations of the model for a particular strength of the transverse field, as
input data for the neural network. Although the proposed method can be employed
using experimental observations of quantum many-body systems, we tested our
technique with spin configurations generated by a quantum Monte Carlo
simulation without initial relaxation. The neural network successfully
classified the strength of transverse field only from the spin configurations,
leading to consistent estimations of the critical point of our model \(\Gamma_c

exponentially with the number of particles. This scaling clearly limits our
ability to do tomography to systems with no more than a few qubits and has been
used to argue against the universal validity of quantum mechanics itself.
However, from a computational learning theory perspective, it can be shown
that, in a probabilistic setting, quantum states can be approximately learned
using only a linear number of measurements. Here we experimentally demonstrate
this linear scaling in optical systems with up to 6 qubits. Our results
highlight the power of computational learning theory to investigate quantum
information, provide the first experimental demonstration that quantum states
can be &quot;probably approximately learned&quot; with access to a number of copies of
the state that scales linearly with the number of qubits, and pave the way to
probing quantum states at new, larger scales.">"Experimental learning of quantum states"</a>,

data is one goal of machine learning in condensed matter and statistical
physics. Supervised algorithms trained on raw samples of microstates can
successfully detect conventional phase transitions via learning a bulk feature
such as an order parameter. In this paper, we investigate whether neural
networks can learn to classify phases based on topological defects. We address
this question on the two-dimensional classical XY model which exhibits a
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We find significant feature engineering of the
raw spin states is required to convincingly claim that features of the vortex
configurations are responsible for learning the transition temperature. We
further show a single-layer network does not correctly classify the phases of
the XY model, while a convolutional network easily performs classification by
learning the global magnetization. Finally, we design a deep network capable of
learning vortices without feature engineering. We demonstrate the detection of
vortices does not necessarily result in the best classification accuracy,
especially for lattices of less than approximately 1000 spins. For larger
systems, it remains a difficult task to learn vortices.">"Machine learning vortices at the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition"</a>,

obtaining phase diagrams when traditional regression schemes using local
equilibrium order parameters are not available, as in many-body localized or
topological phases. Nevertheless, instances of machine learning offering new
insights have been rare up to now. Here we show that a single feed-forward
neural network can decode the defining structures of two distinct MBL phases
and a thermalizing phase, using entanglement spectra obtained from individual
eigenstates. For this, we introduce a simplicial geometry based method for
extracting multi-partite phase boundaries. We find that this method outperforms
conventional metrics (like the entanglement entropy) for identifying MBL phase
transitions, revealing a sharper phase boundary and shedding new insight into
the topology of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the phase diagram we acquire
from a single disorder configuration confirms that the machine-learning based
approach we establish here can enable speedy exploration of large phase spaces
that can assist with the discovery of new MBL phases. To our knowledge this
work represents the first example of a machine learning approach revealing new
information beyond conventional knowledge.">"Machine learning out-of-equilibrium phases of matter"</a>,

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00725v1" title="Studying general quantum many-body systems is one of the major challenges in
modern physics because it requires an amount of computational resources that
scales exponentially with the size of the system.Simulating the evolution of a
state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact
classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of
restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently
represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and
ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a new representation of states
based on variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders are a type of
generative model in the form of a neural network. We probe the power of this
representation by encoding probability distributions associated with states
from different classes. Our simulations show that deep networks give a better
representation for states that are hard to sample from, while providing no
benefit for random states. This suggests that the probability distributions
associated to hard quantum states might have a compositional structure that can
be exploited by layered neural networks. Specifically, we consider the
learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans.
Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for
quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good
level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be
suitable for characterising states of the size expected in first generation
quantum hardware.">"Learning hard quantum distributions with variational autoencoders"</a>,

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08015v1" title="Our understanding of supercooled liquids and glasses has lagged significantly
behind that of simple liquids and crystalline solids. This is in part due to
the many possibly relevant degrees of freedom that are present due to the
disorder inherent to these systems and in part to non-equilibrium effects which
are difficult to treat in the standard context of statistical physics. Together
these issues have resulted in a field whose theories are under-constrained by
experiment and where fundamental questions are still unresolved. Mean field
results have been successful in infinite dimensions but it is unclear to what
extent they apply to realistic systems and assume uniform local structure. At
odds with this are theories premised on the existence of structural defects.
However, until recently it has been impossible to find structural signatures
that are predictive of dynamics. Here we summarize and recast the results from
several recent papers offering a data driven approach to building a
phenomenological theory of disordered materials by combining machine learning
with physical intuition.">"Combining Machine Learning and Physics to Understand Glassy Systems"</a>,

to map out the quantum phase diagram of disordered topological superconductor
in class DIII. Given the disorder that keeps the discrete symmetries of the
ensemble as a whole, translational symmetry which is broken in the
quasiparticle distribution individually is recovered statistically by taking an
ensemble average. By using this, we classify the phases by the artificial
neural network that learned the quasiparticle distribution in the clean limit,
and show that the result is totally consistent with the calculation by the
transfer matrix method or noncommutative geometry approach. If all three
phases, namely the \(\mathbb{Z}_2\), trivial, and the thermal metal phases appear
in the clean limit, the machine can classify them with high confidence over the
entire phase diagram. If only the former two phases are present, we find that
the machine remains confused in the certain region, leading us to conclude the
detection of the unknown phase which is eventually identified as the thermal
metal phase. In our method, only the first moment of the quasiparticle
distribution is used for input, but application to a wider variety of systems
is expected by the inclusion of higher moments.">"Learning Disordered Topological Phases by Statistical Recovery of

emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our
society. The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information
(QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have
their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely
independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been
probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from
each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML,
investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve
the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both
directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital
application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our &quot;big data&quot; world.
Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become
instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in
data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments,
quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning,
highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works
exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for
performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first
successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also
broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts.
This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a
world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the
main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research

that the network does learn the discrete version of the winding number formula.

better than shallow networks for many tasks in machine learning. In statistical
physics, while there has been recent interest in representing physical data
with generative modelling, the focus has been on shallow neural networks. A
natural question to ask is whether deep neural networks hold any advantage over
shallow networks in representing such data. We investigate this question by
using unsupervised, generative graphical models to learn the probability
distribution of a two-dimensional Ising system. Deep Boltzmann machines, deep
belief networks, and deep restricted Boltzmann networks are trained on thermal
spin configurations from this system, and compared to the shallow architecture
of the restricted Boltzmann machine. We benchmark the models, focussing on the
accuracy of generating energetic observables near the phase transition, where
these quantities are most difficult to approximate. Interestingly, after
training the generative networks, we observe that the accuracy essentially
depends only on the number of neurons in the first hidden layer of the network,
and not on other model details such as network depth or model type. This is
evidence that shallow networks are more efficient than deep networks at
representing physical probability distributions associated with Ising systems

external field. We employ a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer,
which is trained on labeled entanglement spectra pertaining to the fully
localized and fully thermal regimes. We then apply this network to classify
spectra belonging to states in the transition region. For training, we use a
cost function that contains, in addition to the usual error and regularization
parts, a term that favors a confident classification of the transition region
states. The resulting phase diagram is in good agreement with the one obtained
by more conventional methods and can be computed for small systems. In
particular, the neural network outperforms conventional methods in classifying
individual eigenstates pertaining to a single disorder realization. It allows
us to map out the structure of these eigenstates across the transition with
spatial resolution. Furthermore, we analyze the network operation using the
dreaming technique to show that the neural network correctly learns by itself
the power-law structure of the entanglement spectra in the many-body localized
regime.">"Probing many-body localization with neural networks"</a>,

preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of
the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between
compression and prediction, successively, for each layer.
  In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of
the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\emph compression} of the
input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii)
The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes
small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift
to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion,
constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or
very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps
from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output
satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise
mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks.
(iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers.
Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be
explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06652v1" title="Security for machine learning has begun to become a serious issue for present
day applications. An important question remaining is whether emerging quantum
technologies will help or hinder the security of machine learning. Here we
discuss a number of ways that quantum information can be used to help make
quantum classifiers more secure or private. In particular, we demonstrate a
form of robust principal component analysis that, under some circumstances, can
provide an exponential speedup relative to robust methods used at present. To
demonstrate this approach we introduce a linear combinations of unitaries
Hamiltonian simulation method that we show functions when given an imprecise
Hamiltonian oracle, which may be of independent interest. We also introduce a
new quantum approach for bagging and boosting that can use quantum
superposition over the classifiers or splits of the training set to aggregate
over many more models than would be possible classically. Finally, we provide a
private form of \(k\)--means clustering that can be used to prevent an all
powerful adversary from learning more than a small fraction of a bit from any
user. These examples show the role that quantum technologies can play in the
security of ML and vice versa. This illustrates that quantum computing can
provide useful advantages to machine learning apart from speedups.">"Hardening Quantum Machine Learning Against Adversaries"</a>,

where quantum computer could provide exponential speedup over any classical
computer. Machine learning represents an important field with broad
applications where quantum computer may offer significant speedup. Several
quantum algorithms for discriminative machine learning have been found based on
efficient solving of linear algebraic problems, with potential exponential
speedup in runtime under the assumption of effective input from a quantum
random access memory. In machine learning, generative models represent another
large class which is widely used for both supervised and unsupervised learning.
Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a
quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is exponentially
more powerful to represent probability distributions compared with classical
generative models and has exponential speedup in training and inference at
least for some instances under a reasonable assumption in computational
complexity theory. Our result opens a new direction for quantum machine
learning and offers a remarkable example in which a quantum algorithm shows
exponential improvement over any classical algorithm in an important
application field.">"An efficient quantum algorithm for generative machine learning"</a>,

probabilistic graphical models that can model sequential data. We extend
previous work on HQMMs with three contributions: (1) we show how classical
hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be simulated on a quantum circuit, (2) we
reformulate HQMMs by relaxing the constraints for modeling HMMs on quantum
circuits, and (3) we present a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters of
an HQMM from data. While our algorithm requires further optimization to handle
larger datasets, we are able to evaluate our algorithm using several synthetic
datasets. We show that on HQMM generated data, our algorithm learns HQMMs with
the same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the true HQMMs,
while HMMs learned with the Baum-Welch algorithm require more states to match
the predictive accuracy.">"Learning Hidden Quantum Markov Models"</a>,

inside two coupledcavities. Using a digital-analog decomposition of the master
equation that rules the system dynamics, we show that this approach leads to
quantum synchronization between both two-level systems. Moreover, we can
identify in this digital-analog block decomposition the fundamental elements of
a quantum machine learning protocol, in which the agent and the environment
(learning units) interact through a mediating system, namely, the register. If
we can additionally equip this algorithm with a classical feedback mechanism,
which consists of projective measurements in the register, reinitialization of
the register state and local conditional operations on the agent and register
subspace, a powerful and flexible quantum machine learning protocol emerges.
Indeed, numerical simulations show that this protocol enhances the
synchronization process, even when every subsystem experience different
loss/decoherence mechanisms, and give us flexibility to choose the
synchronization state. Finally, we propose an implementation based on current
technologies in superconducting circuits.">"Enhanced Quantum Synchronization via Quantum Machine Learning"</a>,

limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical
counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for

devices and validating underpinning physical models, are central challenges for
the development of quantum technologies and for our continued understanding of
foundational physics. Machine-learning enhanced by quantum simulators has been
proposed as a route to improve the computational cost of performing these
studies. Here we interface two different quantum systems through a classical
channel - a silicon-photonics quantum simulator and an electron spin in a
diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre - and use the former to learn the latter's
Hamiltonian via Bayesian inference. We learn the salient Hamiltonian parameter
with an uncertainty of approximately \(10^{-5}\). Furthermore, an observed
saturation in the learning algorithm suggests deficiencies in the underlying
Hamiltonian model, which we exploit to further improve the model itself. We go
on to implement an interactive version of the protocol and experimentally show
its ability to characterise the operation of the quantum photonic device. This
work demonstrates powerful new quantum-enhanced techniques for investigating
foundational physical models and characterising quantum technologies.">"Experimental Quantum Hamiltonian Learning"</a>,
